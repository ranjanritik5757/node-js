INTERVIEW QUESTION
-> Node JS is ASYNC LANGUAGE and SINGLE THREADED
-> what is sync and async language 
   sync language means , when the code is executedd , it is executed line by line , like the 3rd line would only be executed after the completion of the 
   2nd line , 3rd line would wait to be executed after the 2nd line is executed .
   But async language means , it would not wait for the completion of the execution of the 2nd line , it would start executing the 3rd line and whenever 
   the 2nd line's execution is completed , then it gives the output but it never waits . Thats why JAVASCRIPT/NODEJS is such a fast language because its an 
   async language.
