--- package json file ---

What does package.json file does ? 
it keeps the track of all the details of the projects , like project version , name , git repo , commands used , the different packages installed.

installed package json file -> npm init

when we install package.json file , and type command npm init , then it asks all the details.

we can install any package using the commands involved for the packages

note : when we give the project to any other developer then how would he know the packages involved in the projects. he would know it from package.json
      and for him to install all the packages at once , all he needs to do it type command npm i / npm install

when we download any package , along with it many other dependent package.

Now another file called package-lock.json is also created :
    now package.json involves the details of the project but package-lock.json would keep the details of the packages.

Now deleting package-lock.json wont do much harm , but if pacakge.json is deleted , then its like maa chud ga  yi
