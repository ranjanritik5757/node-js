what if we mistakenly deleted the node modules file ?
run the command : npm install

when we push the code into github , we need not to push the node_modules file , because the size of it is very large , how do we ignore it ?
create .gitignore file and put the names of the files you dont want to push

-> how to install node modules
-> how to recover deleted node modules
-> should we push node modules into github , ans : no large size 
  solution : create .gitignore file
